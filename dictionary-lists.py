lst = [2, 3, 4]  # this is a list
dct = {"Name": "John", "Surname": "Smith", "Age": 27}  # this is a "dictionary"

dct["Name"]  # this is how you extract the variable "Name" from the dictionary "dct"
dct["Age"]  # this is how to extract the variable "Age" from the "dct"

lst  # prints (in python cmd line) the list
dct  # prints (in python cmd line) the dictionary

# another way to write dictionaries is:
dct2 = {"Name": ("Peter"), "Surname": ("Griffin"), "Age": (42)}

dct3 = {"Cities": ("Porto", "San Diego", "Austin")}

dct3["Cities"]

dct2 ["Surname"]
